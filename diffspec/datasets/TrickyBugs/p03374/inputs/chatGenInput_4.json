The input examples found in the text dump are as follows:

1. **First Example (with "INPUT:" prefix):**
   ```
   INPUT:
   3 20
   2 80
   9 120
   16 1
   OUTPUT:
   191
   ```

2. **Second Example (with "INPUT:" prefix):**
   ```
   INPUT:
   3 20
   2 80
   9 120
   16 1
   OUTPUT:
   191
   ```

3. **Third Example (with "INPUT:" prefix):**
   ```
   INPUT:
   3 20
   2 80
   9 120
   16 1
   OUTPUT:
   191
   ```

4. **Test Case's Input (code block):**
   ```
   **Input:**
   ```
   2 10
   2 100
   9 100
   ```

5. **Final Answer's Code Block (same as test case's input):**
   ```
   âœ… **Final Answer:**
   ```
   2 10
   2 100
   9 100
   ```

These examples are identified based on the presence of "INPUT:" (uppercase) or "Input:" (lowercase) prefixes, as well as code blocks containing input data. Note that the final answer's code block is identical to the test case's input.

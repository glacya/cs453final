The provided text contains multiple input examples, which can be categorized into two groups:

1. **Problem Examples** (from the constraints section):
   - These are input lines prefixed with `"INPUT:"` and followed by the actual input data.
   - Each input is followed by an output, but only the input is relevant for this task.

2. **Test Cases** (from the test case section):
   - These are input data enclosed within triple-backtick code blocks.
   - Each test case has a label and an associated input.

### ðŸ“Œ **Summary**

- **Total Input Examples:** 12  
- **Format:** Each input is a multi-line string, with the first line being the number of elements, and the subsequent lines being the actual values.  
- **Note:** Test Cases 3 and 8 have identical input data, but they are treated as separate entries as per the text.

This list captures all the input examples from both the problem constraints and the test cases.

The given code has a few issues:

1. The conditions in the if-else statement are incorrect. The condition in the if statement should be `k <= a`, not `a >= k`. Similarly, the condition in the else statement should be `k > a` instead of `a < k`.

2. The calculations to determine the maximum possible sum are incorrect. Instead of subtracting `(k-a-b)` from `a`, we need to subtract `b` and `c` from `k` to get the remaining number of cards to be picked from cards with value 1. This remaining number should then be added to the number of cards with value 1.

Here is the corrected code:

a, b, c, k = map(int, input().split())
if k <= a:
    print(k)
else:
    print(a + (k - a - b))

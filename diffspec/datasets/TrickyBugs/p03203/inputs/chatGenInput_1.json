To determine which parts of the text are considered **input examples**, we must follow the rules provided in the instruction:

---

### ‚úÖ **Rule 1: Code Blocks (Triple-Backtick)**
> *If there are triple-backtick code fences, then the content inside is considered as input examples.*

This means that **any text enclosed within triple-backticks (` ``` `)** is automatically considered an input example, regardless of its content.

---

### ‚úÖ **Rule 2: Prefixed Lines (No Code Blocks)**
> *If there are no triple-backtick code fences, then lines or paragraphs prefixed by "Input:" are considered as input examples.*

This means that **only lines starting with "Input:"** (lowercase) are considered input examples in the absence of code blocks.

### üìú **Analysis of the Text**

Let‚Äôs examine the text provided:

#### 1. **Test Case 1**
```text
```
1 2 1
1 2
```
```
- This is a **code block** (triple-backticks), so it is **considered an input example**.

#### 2. **Test Case 2**
```text
```
2 2 1
2 1
```
```
- This is also a **code block**, so it is **considered an input example**.

#### 3. **Test Case 3**
```text
```
3 3 1
1 3
```
```
- Again, a **code block**, so it is **considered an input example**.

#### 4. **Test Case 4**
```text
```
2 2 0
```
```
- A **code block**, so it is **considered an input example**.

#### 5. **Test Case 5**
```text
```
10 10 1
5 5
```
```
- A **code block**, so it is **considered an input example**.

---

### ‚ùå **Problem's Examples (Not in Code Blocks)**
The text also includes:
```text
INPUT: 3 3 1
3 2
```
- These lines are **not in code blocks**.
- They are **not prefixed by "Input:"** (lowercase), but by **"INPUT:"** (uppercase).
- Therefore, **they are not considered input examples** under the given rules.

---

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion**

Only the **code blocks** from the Test Cases 1 through 5 are considered **input examples** based on the provided rules.

---

### üìå **Final Answer**

The input examples from the text are:

```
1 2 1
1 2
```

```
2 2 1
2 1
```

```
3 3 1
1 3
```

```
2 2 0
```

```
10 10 1
5 5
```

These five code blocks are the only parts of the text that qualify as **input examples**.

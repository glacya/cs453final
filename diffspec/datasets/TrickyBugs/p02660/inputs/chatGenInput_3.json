The input examples provided in the text are the values that follow the lines starting with "Input:" (case-insensitive) or within triple-backtick code fences. Based on the text, the input examples are:

- **24**
- **123**
- **456**
- **8**
- **9**
- **10**

These values are extracted from the lines under the "EXAMPLES:" section (with "INPUT:") and the test cases (with "Input:"). The instruction's mention of "Input:" (lowercase) is interpreted as a case-insensitive match to ensure all relevant input examples are captured. 

**Final Answer:**  
The input examples are: `24`, `123`, `456`, `8`, `9`, and `10`.

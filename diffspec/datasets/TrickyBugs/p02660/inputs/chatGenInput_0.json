The input examples from the text dump, based on the criteria of being either in code fences or lines prefixed by "Input:" (lowercase), are as follows:

1. **Code Block (2):**
   ```
   2
   ```

2. **Code Block (3):**
   ```
   3
   ```

3. **Code Block (5):**
   ```
   5
   ```

4. **Line with "Input:" (lowercase):**
   ```
   **Input:** `N = 2`
   ```

5. **Line with "Input:" (lowercase):**
   ```
   **Input:** `N = 3`
   ```

6. **Line with "Input:" (lowercase):**
   ```
   **Input:** `N = 5`
   ```

**Note:** The examples under the constraints (e.g., `INPUT:`) were not included as they do not match the "Input:" (lowercase) prefix, but they were part of the text dump. If they are to be considered, they would be additional input examples.

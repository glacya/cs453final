The given code has some syntax errors and some logic flaws.

First syntax errors are removed by giving proper indendation on some lines.

There is one logical issue in line 34. We need to use a variable t instead of s2.

The code has another logical issue with the output message line. Instead of printing '\-1\', we need to print -1 (without quotes).

The input examples found in the text are the three instances where the input is explicitly provided in the format of `K X`, which are:

1. **2 900**  
2. **1 501**  
3. **4 2000**  

These examples are presented in code blocks under the "EXAMPLES" section, matching the format described in the problem statement. While other lines (e.g., "K = 1", "X = 1") are prefixed with "Input:", they are not in the required `K X` format and are likely part of the problem description rather than actual input examples. Thus, the valid input examples are the three listed above.  

**Answer:**  
```  
2 900  
1 501  
4 2000  
```

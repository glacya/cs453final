There is a logical error in the code when checking '##' in s[a-1:d]. The condition should check for any occurrence of a rock in s[a-1:d], not a consecutive occurrence.

Also, when checking '...' in s[b-2:d+1], we need to ensure that there are at least two empty squares between B and D. The code should check for '...' and not any occurrence of '.'.

Additionally, the code should print 'No' if any conditions are not satisfied, instead of printing 'Yes'. Finally, the code is missing a newline after printing the output.

Here is the repaired code:

n, a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

if c > d:
    if '...' in s[b - 2:d + 1] and '##' not in s[a - 1:d]:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
else:
    if '##' in s[a - 1:d]:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')

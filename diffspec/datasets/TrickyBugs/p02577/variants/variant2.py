**COMMENTS**:
The code checks whether the input number is divisible by 3, but it should be checking whether the input number is divisible by 9. We can modify the code to find whether the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the input number is divisible by 9.

**PLAN**:
1. Read the input number as a string.
2. Convert each digit of the input number from string to integer and calculate the sum of the digits.
3. Check whether the sum of the digits is divisible by 9.
4. If the sum of the digits is divisible by 9, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

I will now implement this plan in the code and update it accordingly.

To extract all input examples from the provided text, we need to identify all code blocks that represent input data in the format:

```
<first_line>
<second_line>
```

These code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (` ``` `) and represent the input format used in the problem statement examples.

### Step-by-Step Extraction

1. **First Input Example**  
   Located under the section:  
   > **Test Case 1: Exposes loop range error for N=1**  
   Code block:
   ```
   1 10
   5
   ```

2. **Second Input Example**  
   Located under the section:  
   > **Test Case 2: N = 2, X = 100, positions = [1, 10]**  
   Code block:
   ```
   2 100
   1 10
   ```

3. **Third Input Example**  
   Located under the section:  
   > **Final Answer**  
   Code block:
   ```
   1 10
   5
   ```

This third code block is **identical** to the first one, so it is a **duplicate**.

### Final Answer

Since the problem asks to extract **all** input examples, including duplicates, the final list of input examples is:

```python
[
    "1 10\n5",
    "2 100\n1 10",
    "1 10\n5"
]
```

However, if the goal is to extract **unique** input examples, the answer would be:

```python
[
    "1 10\n5",
    "2 100\n1 10"
]
```

### âœ… Final Answer (Unique Input Examples)

```python
[
    "1 10\n5",
    "2 100\n1 10"
]
```

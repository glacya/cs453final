# Problem Analysis
We are given an integer K and we need to find the smallest possible sum of the digits in the decimal notation of a positive multiple of K.

# Plan
1. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
2. Let dp[i] represent the smallest possible sum of the digits in the decimal notation of a positive multiple of i.
3. Initialize dp[i] = K+1 for all i.
4. Set dp[1] = 1 as it is a special case.
5. Iterate from i = 1 to i = K.
	* For each i, we can set dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[i]).
	* Then, we need to find the next positive multiple of i and update dp[j], where j = (10 * i) % K.
	* We can accomplish this using a loop function.
		* Let j = (10 * i) % K.
		* First, we check if dp[i] < dp[j-1] + 1 and dp[i] < dp[j].
			* If it is true, then we update dp[j] = dp[i] and return j, True.
		* Next, we check if dp[j-1] + 1 < dp[i] and dp[j-1] + 1 < dp[j].
			* If it is true, then we update dp[j] = dp[j-1] + 1 and return j, True.
		* If both conditions fail, then we return j, False.
		* Finally, we update dp[0] = min(dp[K - 1] + 1, dp[0]).
		* Print dp[0] as the smallest possible sum of the digits.

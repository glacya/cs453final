The task is to extract all **input examples** from the provided text dump. According to the instructions, input examples are defined as:

1. **Lines starting with "INPUT:"** followed by the input data.
2. **Code fences** that contain input data (even if they do not explicitly mention "INPUT:"), provided they look like input.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Extraction

#### 1. **Lines Starting with "INPUT:"**
The text dump includes the following lines that match this pattern:

- `INPUT:
1 3 2`
- `INPUT:
1 3 1`
- `INPUT:
2 3 3`
- `INPUT:
2 3 1`
- `INPUT:
7 1 1`
- `INPUT:
15 8 5`

These are the **input examples** as per the problem's constraints and examples.

#### 2. **Code Fences Containing Input Data**
The text dump includes a code fence that contains input data:

```python
# Test Case: H = 1, W = 8, K = 1
```

However, this is **not** an input example in the required format (`H W K`). It is a test case explanation, not an input example.

### ✅ Final Answer

The input examples extracted from the text dump are:

```plaintext
1 3 2
1 3 1
2 3 3
2 3 1
7 1 1
15 8 5
```

These are the valid input examples that match the required format.

To determine how many ways we can arrange a string of length 6 consisting of **3 A's** and **3 other characters (B, N, N)** such that **no two A's are adjacent**, we can use a combinatorial approach that ensures the A's are not placed next to each other.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Structure

We are given:
- 3 A's (identical)
- 3 other characters: B, N, N (where N is repeated twice)

So, the total number of characters is 6, and we are to arrange them such that **no two A's are adjacent**.

---

### Step 2: Fix the Positions of Non-A Characters

To ensure that no two A's are adjacent, we can first **place the non-A characters** (B, N, N) in some order, and then **insert the A's into the available gaps** between and around these characters.

The non-A characters are: B, N, N

The number of distinct arrangements of these 3 characters is:

$$
\frac{3!}{2!} = 3
$$

These are:
1. B N N  
2. N B N  
3. N N B

### Step 3: Determine the Gaps for A's

Once the non-A characters are arranged, we can insert the A's into the **gaps** between and around them.

For any arrangement of 3 non-A characters, there are **4 gaps** available for placing the A's:

- Before the first character
- Between the first and second
- Between the second and third
- After the third character

So, for each arrangement of the non-A characters, we can choose **3 out of the 4 gaps** to place the A's.

The number of ways to choose 3 gaps from 4 is:

$$
\binom{4}{3} = 4
$$

---

### Step 4: Multiply the Possibilities

For each of the 3 distinct arrangements of the non-A characters, we have 4 valid ways to place the A's such that no two A's are adjacent.

So, the total number of valid arrangements is:

$$
3 \times 4 = 12
$$

### âœ… Final Answer

$$
\boxed{12}

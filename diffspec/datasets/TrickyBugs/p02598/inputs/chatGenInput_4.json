The input examples from the text dump are as follows:

1. **Code Block Example**:
   ```
   input :     
   ```
   The content inside the code block is:
   ```
   1 1
   5
   ```
   This is an input example because it is enclosed in triple-backtick code fences.

2. **Problem Statement Examples**:
   - **First Example**:
     ```
     INPUT:
     2 3
     7 9
     ```
   - **Second Example**:
     ```
     INPUT:
     3 0
     3 4 5
     ```
   - **Third Example**:
     ```
     INPUT:
     10 10
     158260522 877914575 602436426 24979445 861648772 623690081 433933447 476190629 262703497 211047202
     ```

   These are considered input examples because they are prefixed by "INPUT:" (uppercase), even though the instruction specifies "Input:" (lowercase). The user's examples in the problem statement are part of the text dump and are likely intended to be input examples.

**Final Answer**:
The input examples are:
1. The code block with the lines `1 1` and `5`.
2. The three examples from the problem statement, each prefixed by `INPUT:` and containing the respective input data.

To determine which parts of the text qualify as **input examples**, we must strictly follow the user's instructions:

---

### ✅ **Rule 1: Code Fences**
> "1. Recognize triple-backtick code fences, whether or not they contain the word 'Input:' but it looks like a input."

This means **any block of text enclosed in triple backticks (` ``` `)** is considered an input example, **regardless of its content**.

---

### ✅ **Rule 2: Prefixed Lines**
> "2. If there is no triple-backtick code fences, recognize lines or paragraphs prefixed by 'Input:' even outside fences."

This means **any line or paragraph starting with 'Input:'** is also considered an input example.

---

### ❌ **Rule 3: Case Sensitivity**
> The instruction explicitly says to look for **"Input:"** (lowercase), not **"INPUT:"** (uppercase). Therefore, **uppercase prefixes are not considered valid input examples**.

### 📜 **Text Analysis**

#### 1. **"EXAMPLES" Section**
- The input examples are written as:
  ```
  INPUT:
  6 4
  -10 8 2 1 2 6
  ```
  - These are **not** in code fences.
  - They are **not** prefixed with "Input:" (lowercase), but with "INPUT:" (uppercase).
  - **Conclusion**: These are **not** valid input examples under the user's rules.

#### 2. **Test Cases After Conclusion**
- Each test case has an input in a **code fence**:
  ```text
  # Test Case 1: Off-by-one error in loop bounds
  input :     
  ```
  2 2
  -5 -3
  ```

  ```text
  # Test Case 2: Missing the case of taking zero jewels
  input :     
  ```
  2 2
  -5 -3
  ```

  ```text
  # Test Case 3: Invalid loop range when K > N
  input :     
  ```
  3 5
  -10 -20 -30
  ```

  - All three are **code fences**.
  - **Conclusion**: These are **valid input examples**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer**

```json
[
  "2 2\n-5 -3",
  "2 2\n-5 -3",
  "3 5\n-10 -20 -30"
]
```

These are the only valid input examples from the text, as they are enclosed in code fences. The "EXAMPLES" section's input is not considered valid under the user's rules.

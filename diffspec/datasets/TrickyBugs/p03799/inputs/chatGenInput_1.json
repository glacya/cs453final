The input examples provided in the text are:

1. `1 6`  
2. `12345 678901`

These are the only two instances where the input is explicitly formatted as `N M` and accompanied by an output. Other sections in the text describe examples or explanations but do not represent valid input examples in the required format.

**Answer:**  
```json
["1 6", "12345 678901"]
```

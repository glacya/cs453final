To extract the **input examples** from the provided text, we need to identify the parts of the text that represent **input data** in the format expected by the problem. According to the problem description, the input is given in the format:

```
N M
```

Where `N` and `M` are integers.

### Step-by-Step Extraction:

1. **Identify Input Blocks**:
   - The text contains two explicit input blocks under the **"EXAMPLES:"** section:
     - `INPUT: 1 6`
     - `INPUT: 12345 678901`

   These are clearly formatted as input examples.

2. **Exclude Other Examples**:
   - There is a section that says:
     ```
     Letâ€™s test the code with the example:
     - `n = 1`, `m = 5`
     ```
     This is part of the **explanation** or **example usage**, not an input example in the required format.

   - Another section:
     ```
     # Example 1:
     - `n = 1`, `m = 6`
     ```
     This is also part of the **explanation**, not an input example.

### Final Answer:

The valid input examples in the required format are:

```json
["1 6", "12345 678901"]
```

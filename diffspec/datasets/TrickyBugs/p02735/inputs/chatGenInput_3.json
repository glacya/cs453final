The task is to extract **input examples** from the provided text dump, based on the following criteria:

1. **Code blocks** enclosed in triple backticks (` ``` `) that **look like input examples** (i.e., they follow the format of H W followed by H lines of data).
2. **Lines or paragraphs** that are **prefixed with "Input:"** (or similar) and may contain input data.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. **Code Block Under "Test Case 1: Shared Rows in a 2D List"**

This is a **code block** enclosed in triple backticks:

```plaintext
2 2
.
#

#
#
```

- It starts with `2 2`, which could represent H and W (height and width).
- It has 5 lines, but only 2 lines of data (`.`, `#`, `#`, `#`) — this is **not consistent** with the expected format of H W followed by H lines of data.
- However, **it is a code block** and **looks like an input example** (even if it's malformed), so it **should be extracted**.

#### 2. **Line Prefixed with "input :"**

There is a line in the text dump:

```
input :     
```
```
2 2
.
#

#
#
```

- This line is **not** a code block, but it is **prefixed with "input :"**, which is similar to "Input:".
- The **code block** that follows is **part of the input example**.
- Since the code block is **already extracted** in the previous step, this is **not a new input example**.

#### 3. **Other Code Blocks in the Text**

Other code blocks in the text (e.g., the "Buggy code" and "Correct code" blocks) are **part of the explanation**, not input examples. They should **not** be extracted.

### Final Answer

The only **input example** that meets the criteria is the **code block** under "Test Case 1: Shared Rows in a 2D List".

```plaintext
2 2

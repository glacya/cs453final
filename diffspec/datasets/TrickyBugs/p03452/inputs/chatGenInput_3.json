To determine the correct input examples, we follow the user's instruction to extract **code blocks** (enclosed in triple backticks) and **lines starting with "Input:"** from the text.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Code Blocks**:
   - These are clearly marked by triple backticks (````...````) and represent input examples.
   - They are the primary focus of the instruction.

2. **Lines Starting with "Input:"**:
   - These are not enclosed in code blocks but are part of the text.
   - According to the instruction, such lines should also be considered as input examples.

### Extracted Input Examples

From the text dump, we identify the following input examples:

#### 1. Code Block (Python)
```python
edges = [(1, 2, 5)]
```

#### 2. Code Block (Test Case 1)
```plaintext
2 1
1 2 5
```

#### 3. Code Block (Test Case 2)
```plaintext
2 2
1 2 5
1 2 6
```

#### 4. Code Block (Test Case 3)
```plaintext
2 3
1 2 5
1 2 6
1 2 7
```

#### 5. Code Block (Test Case 4)
```plaintext
2 3
1 2 5
1 2 6
1 2 7
```

#### 6. Line Starting with "Input:"
```
Input:
```

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{
[
  "edges = [(1, 2, 5)]",

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a text dump and extract all input examples into a JSON list. The instructions are pretty specific, so I need to be careful.

First, the constraints say that input examples are either in triple-backtick code fences (regardless of whether they have "Input:") or lines/paragraphs starting with "Input:". Also, I need to discard anything that isn't part of an input example.

Looking at the provided text dump, I need to scan through and find all such input blocks. Let me go through the text step by step.

Starting from the top, there's a section with "### ‚úÖ **Key Insight:**" and then some explanation. Then there are two example test cases. Each has a section like "#### Input:" followed by code blocks. Wait, but the user mentioned that even if there's no triple-backticks, lines starting with "Input:" are considered. However, in the examples provided, the input is within code fences. So I need to check both possibilities.

Looking at the text dump, there's a part that says:

### üß† **Example Test Case 1:**

#### Input:
```python
larger_array = [
    ['#', '.'],
    ['.', '.'],
    ['.', '#']
]
template = [
    ['#', '.'],
    ['.', '#']
]
```

This is inside a code fence, so that's an input example. Similarly, the next example test case 2 has the same structure. Then, further down, there's a section labeled "## Test Case 1: ..." with an "input :" followed by a code block. Same for Test Case 2.

Wait, the user's text dump includes:

# Test Case 1: ... input :     
```
3 2

#..
...
.
#.

#.
.
#
```

And similarly for Test Case 2. So these are input examples. Also, the earlier examples in the text dump (the ones with "#### Input:") are also input examples. But the user's instruction says to extract all input examples, regardless of whether they are in code fences or not, as long as they are prefixed with "Input:".

But in the text dump, the first example test case 1 has the input inside a code fence. The second example test case 2 also has input inside a code fence. Then, further down, there are two more input examples, each starting with "input :" followed by a code block.

So I need to collect all these. Let me list them:

1. The first example test case 1's input is inside a code block. The code block starts with ```python and has the input data. But wait, the actual input format is N M followed by N lines of A_i and M lines of B_i. So the code block in the example test case 1 is the input. But the user's instruction says to extract the input examples. So the code block in that example is an input example.

Wait, but the user's text dump includes the input examples as part of the text. For example, in the first example test case, the input is:

#### Input:
```python
larger_array = [
    ['#', '.'],
    ['.', '.'],
    ['.', '#']
]
template = [
    ['#', '.'],
    ['.', '#']
]
```

But the actual input format for the problem is N M followed by N lines of A_i and M lines of B_i. So the code block here is not in the correct format. Wait, but the user's examples in the problem statement have inputs like:

INPUT:
3 2
#.#
.#.
#.#
#.
.#

Which is the correct format. So perhaps the code blocks in the text dump are not the actual input examples but are part of the explanation. However, the user's instruction says to extract all input examples, regardless of their format, as long as they are in code fences or prefixed with "Input:".

Wait, the user's instruction says:

1. Recognize triple-backtick code fences, whether or not they contain the word ‚ÄúInput:‚Äù but it looks like an input.
2. If there is no triple-backtick code fences, recognize lines or paragraphs prefixed by ‚ÄúInput:‚Äù even outside fences.

So, the code blocks in the text dump that are labeled as Input: are input examples. But in the text dump, the first example test case 1's input is inside a code block. However, the code block is part of the explanation, not the actual input. Wait, but the user's text dump includes the input examples as part of the text. For example, the text dump has:

# Test Case 1: Template rows are present in different rows of the larger array, not aligned vertically
input :     
```
3 2

#..
...
.
#.

#.
.
#
```

So this is an input example. Similarly for Test Case 2. Also, there are other input examples in the text dump. Let me check all instances.

Looking through the text dump:

- The first example test case 1's input is inside a code block. But the code block is part of the explanation, not the actual input. Wait, but the user's instruction says to extract input examples. So perhaps the code blocks that are part of the examples (like the ones under "Example Test Case 1") are not the actual input examples but are part of the explanation. However, the user's instruction says to extract all input examples, regardless of their format, as long as they are in code fences or prefixed with "Input:".

Wait, the user's text dump includes:

In the first example test case, the input is:

#### Input:
```python
larger_array = [
    ['#', '.'],
    ['.', '.'],
    ['.', '#']
]
template = [
    ['#', '.'],
    ['.', '#']
]
```

But this is not in the correct format for the problem's input. The problem's input is N M followed by N lines of A_i and M lines of B_i. So this code block is not an input example for the problem. However, according to the user's instruction, any code block that looks like an input is to be extracted. But the user's instruction says to extract input examples, which are the actual input data for the problem.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "extract all of the input examples into a JSON list." The input examples are the ones that are part of the problem's input format. For example, the first example in the problem's examples has:

INPUT:
3 2
#.#
.#.
#.#
#.
.#

Which is the correct format. So the code blocks in the text dump that are part of the examples (like the ones under "Example Test Case 1") are not the actual input examples but are part of the explanation. However, the user's text dump also includes some input examples that are in code blocks or prefixed with "Input:".

Looking at the text dump again, there's a section:

# Test Case 1: Template rows are present in different rows of the larger array, not aligned vertically
input :     
```
3 2

#..
...
.
#.

#.
.
#
```

This is an input example. Similarly for Test Case 2. Also, there's a section:

# Test Case 2: Template rows are present in different rows of the larger array, not aligned vertically
input :     
```
4 2

#...
....
....
.

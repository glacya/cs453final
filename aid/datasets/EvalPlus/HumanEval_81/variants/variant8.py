    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D

              0.0                E

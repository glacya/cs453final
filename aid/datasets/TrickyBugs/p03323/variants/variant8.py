`abs(a-b)` calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which represents the number of pieces of cake that E869120 and square1001 want to take from each other. 
If the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, that means the difference is 0 or 1, so they can both take the desired numbers of pieces of cake without violating the instruction. In this case, the code prints `Yay!`.
Otherwise, if the absolute difference is more than 1, that means the difference is greater than 1, so at least one of them will take adjacent pieces of cake, which violates the instruction. In this case, the code prints `:(`.

The code looks correct and there are no bugs or logic flaws in it.

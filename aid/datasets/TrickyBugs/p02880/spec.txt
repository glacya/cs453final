Having learned the multiplication table, Takahashi can multiply two integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) together.
Given an integer N, determine whether N can be represented as the product of two integers between 1 and 9. If it can, print `Yes`; if it cannot, print `No`.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* N is an integer.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

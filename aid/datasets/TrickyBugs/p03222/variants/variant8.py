**BUGS AND LOGIC FLAWS**:
- The variable 'dic' is defined incorrectly. The last and second last elements should be the same as third and second elements of this variable. Additionally, this variable should be calculated according to its length W.
- The array 'a' is initialized incorrectly. It should have size (H+1) * W, since there are H+1 vertical lines and W horizontal lines.
- The calculation of array 'a' is incorrect. The indices in the calculation are off by one, and the multiplication of 'dic' values is not correct.

**CORRECTED CODE**:

The initial code provided in the problem is sufficiently correct. There are, however, some misinterpretations of the problem statement made in the program. The variable "dic" does not hold a consistent value, which will cause issues when performing calculations. Instead, it should be initialized with fibonacci numbers for each position on the line. I have also changed the names of some variables to be more clear. I will make the fix and provide the corrected program.

import sys

H,W,K=map(int,input().split())
if W==1:
    print(1)
    sys.exit()
elif W==2:
    print(2**(H-1))
    sys.exit()

fibo_seq=[1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]

dp=[[0]*W for i in range(H+1)]
dp[0][0]=1

for i in range(1,H+1):
    dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]*fibo_seq[W-2] + dp[i-1][1]*fibo_seq[W-3]
    for j in range(1,W-1):
        dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]*fibo_seq[j-2]*fibo_seq[W-j-2] + dp[i-1][j]*fibo_seq[j-1]*fibo_seq[W-j-2] + dp[i-1][j+1]*fibo_seq[j-1]*fibo_seq[W-j-3]
    dp[i][W-1] = dp[i-1][W-1]*fibo_seq[W-2] + dp[i-1][W-2]*fibo_seq[W-3]


print(dp[H][K-1]%1000000007)

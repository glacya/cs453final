There are N squares arranged in a row, numbered 1, 2, ..., N from left to right. You are given a string S of length N consisting of `.` and `#`. If the i-th character of S is `#`, Square i contains a rock; if the i-th character of S is `.`, Square i is empty.
In the beginning, Snuke stands on Square A, and Fnuke stands on Square B.
You can repeat the following operation any number of times:
* Choose Snuke or Fnuke, and make him jump one or two squares to the right. The destination must be one of the squares, and it must not contain a rock or the other person.
You want to repeat this operation so that Snuke will stand on Square C and Fnuke will stand on Square D.
Determine whether this is possible.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 4 \leq N \leq 200\ 000
* S is a string of length N consisting of `.` and `#`.
* 1 \leq A, B, C, D \leq N
* Square A, B, C and D do not contain a rock.
* A, B, C and D are all different.
* A < B
* A < C
* B < D

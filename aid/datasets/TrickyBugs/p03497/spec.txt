Takahashi has N balls. Initially, an integer A_i is written on the i-th ball.
He would like to rewrite the integer on some balls so that there are at most K different integers written on the N balls.
Find the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 200000
* 1 \leq A_i \leq N
* All input values are integers.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

OUTPUT:
Print the minimum number of balls that Takahashi needs to rewrite the integers on them.

INPUT:
5 2
1 1 2 2 5

OUTPUT:
1

INPUT:
4 4
1 1 2 2

OUTPUT:
0

INPUT:

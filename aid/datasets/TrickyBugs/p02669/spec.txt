You start with the number 0 and you want to reach the number N.
You can change the number, paying a certain amount of coins, with the following operations:
* Multiply the number by 2, paying A coins.
* Multiply the number by 3, paying B coins.
* Multiply the number by 5, paying C coins.
* Increase or decrease the number by 1, paying D coins.
You can perform these operations in arbitrary order and an arbitrary number of times.
What is the minimum number of coins you need to reach N?
You have to solve T testcases.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 \le T \le 10
* 1 \le N \le 10^{18}
* 1 \le A, B, C, D \le 10^9
* All numbers N, A, B, C, D are integers.

INPUT:
The input is given from Standard Input. The first line of the input is
T
Then, T lines follow describing the T testcases. Each of the T lines has the format
N A B C D

OUTPUT:
For each testcase, print the answer on Standard Output followed by a newline.

The code is almost correct. It correctly handles the case where A > B or B-A > N, but there is a minor bug in the else block. The formula (N-2)*(B-A) will only work if N > 2. For N = 1, the correct answer is 1. For N = 2, the correct answer is 2. We need to handle these special cases separately.

Here is the corrected code:

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())

if A > B or B - A > N:
    print(0)
elif N == 1:
    print(1)
elif N == 2:
    print(2)
else:
    print(1 + (N - 2) * (B - A))

The code provided has a logic flaw in the else part of the code. The calculation of the number of different possible sums is incorrect. The correct calculation should be (B-A) + 1.

Here is the repaired code:

N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
if A > B or B-A > N:
    print(0)
else:
    print(B - A + 1)

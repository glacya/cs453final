In some other world, today is Christmas.
Mr. Takaha decides to make a multi-dimensional burger in his party. A level-L burger (L is an integer greater than or equal to 0) is the following thing:
* A level-0 burger is a patty.
* A level-L burger (L \geq 1) is a bun, a level-(L-1) burger, a patty, another level-(L-1) burger and another bun, stacked vertically in this order from the bottom.
For example, a level-1 burger and a level-2 burger look like `BPPPB` and `BBPPPBPBPPPBB` (rotated 90 degrees), where `B` and `P` stands for a bun and a patty.
The burger Mr. Takaha will make is a level-N burger. Lunlun the Dachshund will eat X layers from the bottom of this burger (a layer is a patty or a bun). How many patties will she eat?

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq X \leq ( the total number of layers in a level-N burger )
* N and X are integers.

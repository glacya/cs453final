Three people, A, B and C, are trying to communicate using transceivers. They are standing along a number line, and the coordinates of A, B and C are a, b and c (in meters), respectively. Two people can directly communicate when the distance between them is at most d meters. Determine if A and C can communicate, either directly or indirectly. Here, A and C can indirectly communicate when A and B can directly communicate and also B and C can directly communicate.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ d ≤ 100
* All values in input are integers.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
a b c d

OUTPUT:
If A and C can communicate, print `Yes`; if they cannot, print `No`.

EXAMPLES:

INPUT:
4 7 9 3

OUTPUT:
Yes

INPUT:
100 10 1 2

OUTPUT:
No

INPUT:
10 10 10 1

OUTPUT:
Yes

INPUT:
1 100 2 10

OUTPUT:
Yes

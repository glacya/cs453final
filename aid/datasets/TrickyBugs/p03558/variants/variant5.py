# Problem Analysis

The problem asks to find the smallest possible sum of the digits in the decimal notation of a positive multiple of K. As a multiple of K is always a positive integer, we can start from 1 and iteratively multiply by 10 until we find a multiple of K.

For every iteration, we need to update the minimum sum of digits required to achieve the multiple. To do this, we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems. 

We can solve the subproblem of finding the minimum sum of digits for a number `i` (0 <= i < K) using dynamic programming. For this, we can store the minimum sum of digits required to reach the number `i` in an array dp. We can update dp[i] with the minimum of dp[i-1]+1 (adding the last digit to the number) and dp[j], where j is ((10 * i) % K) and dp[j] has already been calculated (adding a zero at the end of the number).

After performing dynamic programming on the range 0 to K-1, we can update dp[0] with the minimum of dp[K - 1] + 1 and dp[0] to account for the case where a digit is added at the MSB.

Finally, we can output dp[0] as the smallest possible sum of digits.

# Plan

1. Read the value of K from input.
2. Create a list dp of length K and initialize each element as K+1.
3. Set dp[1] = 1.
4. Iterate i from 1 to K-1:
     - If i != 1, set dp[i] as min(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[i]).
     - Set l = i.
     - Enter a loop:
        - Calculate j = (10 * l) % K.
        - If dp[i] is less than dp[j-1] + 1 and dp[i] is less than dp[j]:
            - Set dp[j] = dp[i].
            - Set 'updated' as True.
            - Set l = j.
        - If dp[j-1] + 1 is less than dp[i] and dp[j-1] + 1 is less than dp[j]:
            - Set dp[j] = dp[j-1] + 1.
            - Set 'updated' as True.
            - Set l = j.
        - If 'updated' is False, break the loop.
5. Set dp[0] as min(dp[K - 1] + 1, dp[0]).
6. Print dp[0].

Given are positive integers A and B.
Let us choose some number of positive common divisors of A and B.
Here, any two of the chosen divisors must be coprime.
At most, how many divisors can we choose?
Definition of common divisor
An integer d is said to be a common divisor of integers x and y when d divides both x and y.
Definition of being coprime
Integers x and y are said to be coprime when x and y have no positive common divisors other than 1.
Definition of dividing
An integer x is said to divide another integer y when there exists an integer \alpha such that y = \alpha x.

You are given an integer sequence of length N, a_1,a_2,...,a_N.
For each 1≤i≤N, you have three choices: add 1 to a_i, subtract 1 from a_i or do nothing.
After these operations, you select an integer X and count the number of i such that a_i=X.
Maximize this count by making optimal choices.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1≤N≤10^5
* 0≤a_i<10^5 (1≤i≤N)
* a_i is an integer.

INPUT:
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

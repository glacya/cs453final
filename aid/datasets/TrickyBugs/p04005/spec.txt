We have a rectangular parallelepiped of size A×B×C, built with blocks of size 1×1×1. Snuke will paint each of the A×B×C blocks either red or blue, so that:
* There is at least one red block and at least one blue block.
* The union of all red blocks forms a rectangular parallelepiped.
* The union of all blue blocks forms a rectangular parallelepiped.
Snuke wants to minimize the difference between the number of red blocks and the number of blue blocks. Find the minimum possible difference.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 2≤A,B,C≤10^9

INPUT:

AtCoDeer the deer found two rectangles lying on the table, each with height 1 and width W. If we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], and the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W], as shown in the following figure:

AtCoDeer will move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle. Find the minimum distance it needs to be moved.

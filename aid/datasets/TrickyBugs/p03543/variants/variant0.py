# Problem Analysis

We are given a 4-digit integer. We need to check if the integer is good or not. An integer is good if it has three or more consecutive same digits.

# Plan

We can check if the integer is good by checking if any of the three consecutive digits are the same.

# Pseudocode

1. Read the input integer N
2. Check if any of the three consecutive digits are the same.
    - Get the tens digit of N using (N//10)%10
    - Get the hundredth digit of N using (N//100)%10
    - Get the thousandth digit of N using N//1000
    - If any two of the three digits are the same, print 'Yes'. Otherwise, print 'No'.

# Dry Run

Let's do a dry run of this approach with the third example:

N = 1234

tens = 3
hundredth = 2
thousandth = 1

None of the three consecutive digits are the same. Therefore, we print 'No'.

# Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this approach is O(1) because we are directly checking the three consecutive digits.

The space complexity is also O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space.

Let's implement the code.

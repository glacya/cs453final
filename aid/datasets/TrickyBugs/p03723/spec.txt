Takahashi, Aoki and Snuke love cookies. They have A, B and C cookies, respectively. Now, they will exchange those cookies by repeating the action below:
* Each person simultaneously divides his cookies in half and gives one half to each of the other two persons.
This action will be repeated until there is a person with odd number of cookies in hand.
How many times will they repeat this action? Note that the answer may not be finite.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 10^9

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

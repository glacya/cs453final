Given is a positive integer N. Consider repeatedly applying the operation below on N:
* First, choose a positive integer z satisfying all of the conditions below:
* z can be represented as z=p^e, where p is a prime number and e is a positive integer;
* z divides N;
* z is different from all integers chosen in previous operations.
* Then, replace N with N/z.
Find the maximum number of times the operation can be applied.

A string S of an odd length is said to be a strong palindrome if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
* S is a palindrome.
* Let N be the length of S. The string formed by the 1-st through ((N-1)/2)-th characters of S is a palindrome.
* The string consisting of the (N+3)/2-st through N-th characters of S is a palindrome.
Determine whether S is a strong palindrome.

CONSTRAINTS:
* S consists of lowercase English letters.
* The length of S is an odd number between 3 and 99 (inclusive).

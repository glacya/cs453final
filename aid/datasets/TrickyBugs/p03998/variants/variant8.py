I will make the following correction:
1. Remove the unnecessary conversion of strings to lists.
2. Iterate over the given condition until some player's deck is empty to determine the winner.
3. Correct the conversion of the current player's deck into a string and find its next turn by taking the first character.
4. Update the current player's deck by removing the first character.
5. Update the i-th player's deck to its updated deck.
6. Update the current player's turn by using next letter.
7. If a player's deck is empty, return its index value appended with 1 to print the winner.

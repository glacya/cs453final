You are given three integers, A, B and C.
Among them, two are the same, but the remaining one is different from the rest.
For example, when A=5,B=7,C=5, A and C are the same, but B is different.
Find the one that is different from the rest among the given three integers.

CONSTRAINTS:
* -100 \leq A,B,C \leq 100
* A, B and C are integers.
* The input satisfies the condition in the statement.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

OUTPUT:
Among A, B and C, print the integer that is different from the rest.

EXAMPLES:

INPUT:
5 7 5

OUTPUT:
7

INPUT:
1 1 7

OUTPUT:
7

INPUT:
-100 100 100

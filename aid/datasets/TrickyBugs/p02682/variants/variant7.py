The code has a logic flaw. 
In the else block, the code is subtracting k from a and b without checking whether k is greater than or equal to a+b.
This will result in a negative value being printed if k is greater than a+b.

Here is the repaired code:

a,b,c,k=map(int,input().split())
if k <= a:
    print(k)
elif k <= a+b:
    print(a)
else:
    print(a-(k-a-b))

We have A cards, each of which has an integer 1 written on it. Similarly, we also have B cards with 0s and C cards with -1s.
We will pick up K among these cards. What is the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen?

CONSTRAINTS:
* All values in input are integers.
* 0 \leq A, B, C
* 1 \leq K \leq A + B + C \leq 2 \times 10^9

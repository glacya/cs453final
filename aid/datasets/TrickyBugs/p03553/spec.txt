We have N gemstones labeled 1 through N.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).
* Select a positive integer x, and smash all the gems labeled with multiples of x.
Then, for each i, if the gem labeled i remains without getting smashed, you will receive a_i yen (the currency of Japan). However, a_i may be negative, in which case you will be charged money.
By optimally performing the operation, how much yen can you earn?

CONSTRAINTS:
* All input values are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* |a_i| \leq 10^9

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

OUTPUT:
Print the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

A programming competition site AtCode provides algorithmic problems. Each problem is allocated a score based on its difficulty. Currently, for each integer i between 1 and D (inclusive), there are p_i problems with a score of 100i points. These p_1 + … + p_D problems are all of the problems available on AtCode.
A user of AtCode has a value called total score. The total score of a user is the sum of the following two elements:
* Base score: the sum of the scores of all problems solved by the user.
* Perfect bonuses: when a user solves all problems with a score of 100i points, he/she earns the perfect bonus of c_i points, aside from the base score (1 ≤ i ≤ D).
Takahashi, who is the new user of AtCode, has not solved any problem. His objective is to have a total score of G or more points. At least how many problems does he need to solve for this objective?

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 ≤ D ≤ 10
* 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100
* 100 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^6
* 100 ≤ G
* All values in input are integers.
* c_i and G are all multiples of 100.
* It is possible to have a total score of G or more points.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
D G
p_1 c_1
:
p_D c_D

OUTPUT:
Print the minimum number of problems that needs to be solved in order to have a total score of G or more points. Note that this objective is always achievable (see Constraints).

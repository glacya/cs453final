We have N sticks with negligible thickness. The length of the i-th stick is A_i.
Snuke wants to select four different sticks from these sticks and form a rectangle (including a square), using the sticks as its sides. Find the maximum possible area of the rectangle.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 4 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* A_i is an integer.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

OUTPUT:
Print the maximum possible area of the rectangle. If no rectangle can be formed, print 0.

A sequence a=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,......\\} is determined as follows:
* The first term s is given as input.
* Let f(n) be the following function: f(n) = n/2 if n is even, and f(n) = 3n+1 if n is odd.
* a_i = s when i = 1, and a_i = f(a_{i-1}) when i > 1.
Find the minimum integer m that satisfies the following condition:
* There exists an integer n such that a_m = a_n (m > n).

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 \leq s \leq 100
* All values in input are integers.
* It is guaranteed that all elements in a and the minimum m that satisfies the condition are at most 1000000.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
s

OUTPUT:
Print the minimum integer m that satisfies the condition.

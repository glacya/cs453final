You are given positive integers N and M.
How many sequences a of length N consisting of positive integers satisfy a_1 \times a_2 \times ... \times a_N = M? Find the count modulo 10^9+7.
Here, two sequences a' and a'' are considered different when there exists some i such that a_i' \neq a_i''.

CONSTRAINTS:
* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^9

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M

OUTPUT:
Print the number of the sequences consisting of positive integers that satisfy the condition, modulo 10^9 + 7.

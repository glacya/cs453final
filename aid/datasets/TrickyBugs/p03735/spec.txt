There are N bags, each containing two white balls. The i-th box contains two balls with integers x_i and y_i written on them, respectively.
For each of these bags, you will paint one of the balls red, and paint the other blue.
Afterwards, the 2N balls will be classified according to color.
Then, we will define the following:
* R_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in red
* R_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in red
* B_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in blue
* B_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in blue
Find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) \times (B_{max} - B_{min}).

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000
* 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9
